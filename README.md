# üí° Enlight üí°

**Enlight** is a personal growth journaling app that allows users to create and manage short posts ("Enlights") across meaningful categories such as Fitness, Travel, Career, and more. Designed as a safe space for sharing thoughts, progress, and insights, Enlight helps users reflect and grow while exploring others' experiences.

##  Why We Built It

This app was created as part of a software engineering project to explore CRUD functionality, full-stack architecture, and RESTful API integration. The goal was to build something meaningful and reflective, a journaling space that combines personal expression with simplicity and elegance.
